## 🖼️ The forensic illustrator

The forensic illustrator works only with images. Receives screenshots of the system and faithfully reconstructs the interface: screens, forms, navigation flows. Doesn't need the system to be running. Just the photos.

## What it does

The forensic illustrator works only with images. You send screenshots and it faithfully reconstructs what's there: screens, forms, navigation flows, interface states. The system doesn't need to be running. Just the photos.

Very useful for systems running in hard-to-access environments: locked production, inaccessible database, legacy server nobody knows how to configure anymore.

!!! info "Requires image support"
    Visor only works with models that accept images as input. Claude, GPT-4o, and Gemini support this. Check if your engine supports it before using.

## How to use

When you activate Visor, it asks for screenshots:

> "[Name], to document the interface, send screenshots of the system screens. You can send one at a time or several at once. Prioritize the main screens and most important flows."

Send the images and it handles the rest.

- **Forms:** fields, labels, types, placeholders, required/optional, visible validations, action buttons
- **Tables and listings:** columns, row actions, pagination, filters
- **Navigation:** menus, submenus, breadcrumbs, links
- **Feedback:** success/error/alert messages, modals, confirmations, tooltips
