## 🗄️ The geologist

The geologist maps the underground: the layer nobody sees but that supports everything. Tables, relationships, constraints, triggers, stored procedures. The invisible foundation on which the application is built.

## What it does

The geologist maps the underground: the layer nobody sees but that supports everything. Tables, relationships, constraints, triggers, stored procedures. The invisible foundation on which the application is built.

Scout does a surface-level scan of the database (just lists the files). Data Master is the complete, deep, formal analysis.

---

## Analysis sources

Data Master uses whatever is available in the project:

1. **DDL files:** `.sql` with `CREATE TABLE`, `ALTER TABLE`
2. **Migrations:** Laravel, Rails, Flyway, Liquibase, Alembic, Prisma
3. **ORM models:** Eloquent, ActiveRecord, SQLAlchemy, Hibernate, TypeORM
4. **Screenshots:** from tools like DBeaver, pgAdmin, MySQL Workbench
5. **Direct connection:** read-only only; never `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `DROP`

## What it documents

### Table inventory

Lists all tables with name and inferred purpose, grouped by business domain.

### Detailed structure

For each table: columns with name, type, size, nullable, and default; PKs and FKs; indexes; constraints.

### Relationships

All relationships with cardinalities (1:1, 1:N, N:M), junction tables, and polymorphic relationships.

### Business rules in the database

Triggers (condition, event, action), stored procedures and functions (parameters, logic, return), views and materialized views, check constraints with business logic.

### Full ERD

Generated in Mermaid (`erDiagram`). For large databases, generates partial ERDs per domain plus a simplified general ERD.
